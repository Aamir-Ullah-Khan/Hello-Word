        "# Pigeonhole Principle\n",
        "# If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with at least two pigeons in it.\n",
        "# Theorem –\n",
        "# I) If “A” is the average number of pigeons per hole, where A is not an integer then\n",
        "# 1) At least one pigeon hole contains ceil[A] (smallest integer greater than or equal to A) pigeons\n",
        "# 2) Remaining pigeon holes contains at most floor[A] (largest integer less than or equal to A) pigeons\n",
        "# II) We can say as, if n + 1 objects are put into n boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects.\n",
        "# The abstract formulation of the principle: Let X and Y be finite sets and let f: X –> Y be a function.\n",
        "# 1) If X has more elements than Y, then f is not one-to-one.\n",
        "# 2) If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is onto, then f is one-to-one.\n",
        "# 3) If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is one-to-one, then f is onto.\n",

        "I am currently a graduate student in Electronics and Communications Engineering at Kocaeli University, Turkey. My MS thesis research is focussed on efficient utilization of bandwidth by using advanced access mechanisms for 5G and beyond networks.  Being an engineer with specialization in telecommunication, I have a deep understanding about technical aspects and working of internet. I believe this is the right time for me to gain further knowledge about internet and learn about the processes involved in making internet related policies."
